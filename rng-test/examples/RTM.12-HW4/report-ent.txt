Entropy = 7.999885 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1600000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1600000 samples is 255.44, and randomly
would exceed this value 48.05 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5290 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.148537871 (error 0.22 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000351 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
