Entropy = 7.999891 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1600000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1600000 samples is 242.22, and randomly
would exceed this value 70.74 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4922 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.144577861 (error 0.10 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000467 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
